MAZE
====

Solve the World's Most Challenging Puzzle \
by Christopher Manson \
Henry Holt and Company, New York, 1985.


What's Here
-----------

This repository walks through solving the maze in the book.  The maze is
essentially an obfuscated graph traversal problem, so the graph is
provided as are graph traversal functions.  The script walks through
trying to find the solution and reexamining clues in the book.  The
script is meant to be read and executed interactively side-by-side.


Personal History
----------------

I was given this book as a kid (early '90s).  In an attempt to solve the
maze, I drew out the whole graph by hand, but I found trying to manually
keep track of traversing all the paths too confusing at the time, so I
couldn't solve it.  Chagrined, I shelved it.

In 2015 I was inspired to try again with a computer, and that
exploration is what ended up here.
